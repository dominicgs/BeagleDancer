BeagleDancer
============

A Facedancer expansion board for the BeagleBone.  Most of the hard work was
done by Travis Goodspeed and Philippe Teuwen.  You can find their projects at
http://goodfet.sf.net and http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/Raspdancer.

It's called "BeagleDancer" because it sounded better than "FaceBone".
